Target Audience: This website is made to target fans of football and sport alike. Since right now the site is very minimal and only pertains one sportsperson, the potential visitors of the website would likely be fans of Jürgen Klopp or fans of one of the clubs that he managed during managerial journey, even fans of the German national team and German football are the target for this site as Klopp is especially loved in his home country. This site doesn't have a target age however it targets all ages simultaneously. If you're researching Jürgen Klopp for a school project this website would be ideal, or if it's a fan of Klopp's potential next club who would like to research more on him to look at what they could be preparing

Goals: The goal of this site are for me to present accurate and reliable information about a key figure of modern football in a tasteful manner that keeps the readers engaged in information. I aim to provide photos detailing Jürgen Klopp's journey along the way so the visitors of the website are not only reading and following the timeline but they also have visual keys to help them see what Klopp has been through during his life.
