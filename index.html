            <h2 id="childhood">Childhood & Early Life</h2>
            <p>Jürgen Norbert Klopp was born on 16th June 1967 in Stuttgart to Elisabeth & Norbert Klopp, who also
                played
                football as a goalkeeper but was persuaded to focus on education by his father so rejected the
                opportunity
                to go professional. Instead he became a travelling salesman selling dowels and wall fixtures for a
                living.
                Since Norbert Klopp was an active sportsman in his youth he shared that part of his life with his son
                Jürgen
                putting him through rigorous physical training. Klopp went on to try many sports in his youth such as
                skiing, tennis, football and padel.</p>
            <p>Jens Haas (childhood friend of Klopp) still remembers the first time he suspected his schoolmate Jurgen
                Klopp had the mind of a football manager. They were 11 years old, being driven to play football for SV
                Glatten's youth team, listening to their beloved Stuttgart's latest Bundesliga match on the radio. Young
                Jurgen began to analyse Stuttgart's tactics - and suggested a couple of substitutions to alter the
                course of the game. Moments later, the commentator confirmed that Klopp's suggested switches were being
                made. "I was amazed by his knowledge and understanding of the game," recalls Haas. "Sometimes I thought
                he was already a coach." Klopp's school days in the Black Forest offer the first clues as to how he grew
                up to become the ultimate modern football manager.</p>
            <p>Jürgen Klopp grew up with two elder sisters in the Black Forest which is a village of Glatten near
                Freudenstadt. Growing up Jürgen Klopp aspired to be a doctor but never believed he was smart enough to
                pursue a career in the field of medicine. In his youth Jürgen Klopp played for many teams including TuS
                Ergenzingen as a junior player, 1. FC Pforzheim and then at, Eintracht Frankfurt II, Viktoria Sindlingen
                and
                Rot-Weiss Frankfurt. In 1988 Jürgen Klopp attended the Goethe University to study sport science, in
                which he
                graduated in 1995</p>
            <p>"Norbert had a big influence on him, he shaped him," recalls Klopp's first coach Ulrich Rath, who founded
                the Glatten Under-11s team in 1972 so that his two sons Ingo and Harti could play for a team alongside
                Klopp and Jens.
                "It's important to know that Norbert Klopp wasn't born here in Glatten. He's from Rhineland-Palatinate,
                close to Mainz. The people from that area celebrate carnival. In Glatten and in the Black Forest, we
                don't," he adds.
                "Norbert was very active here in this club, first in football and then later in tennis. And Jurgen got
                his father's eloquence, enthusiasm and vigour.
                Despite Klopp's subsequent success in lifting numerous trophies in his career, a poignant absence looms
                large in his achievements - his father Norbert. Tragically, Norbert passed away four months before Klopp
                secured his inaugural coaching role at Mainz in 2001. In interviews, Klopp, has openly shared the impact
                Norbert had on his life. He revealed that his father, who faced the disappointment of a prematurely
                ended football career, became a driving force, pushing him forward.

            <h2 id="player">Playing Career</h2>
            <p>Jürgen Klopp played a majority of his career as an amateur and in the lower leagues of German football.
                Whilst Jürgen was playing as an amateur, he worked a number of part time jobs such as a video rental
                store
                clerk and loading heavy goods onto lorries which his naturally bigger physique would have helped him in,
                as
                it was also a big part of his game in his playing career. Klopp was a midfielder and captain for SV
                Glatten's youth teams until he switched in his late teens to TuS Ergenzingen, a bigger team in a town 15
                miles away. Rath describes him as a "bad loser" but a "natural leader". "He was always right at the
                forefront and he spoke up when something was not right," says the 79-year-old Rath. "We had a good
                relationship. He was ambitious. And he would always tell his team-mates 'Let's go' and push them." In
                1981, matches moved across the village to a new sports club, where the yellow and black colours of the
                local team are an uncanny match for those of Borussia Dortmund.
                In 1990, at the age of 23, he moved 30 miles west to sign a semi-professional contract with second
                division team Mainz 05, under the watchful gaze of club captain Michael Schumacher. "Klopp was a typical
                student at this time, in both looks and personality," laughs the 62-year-old, sitting in a corporate
                suite at Mainz's new 34,000-seater stadium, a gleaming symbol of the club's dramatic rise under Klopp's
                management. "He was always wearing jeans and a T-shirt and was really easy-going with no stress."</p>
            <p>Klopp played a majority of his career for Mainz 05 spanning 11 years and ending in 2001.
                Whilst
                Jürgen Klopp played for Mainz he immediately became a fan favorite due to his positive attitude and
                commitment to the club. A switch to defence under the tutelage of influential coach Wolfgang Frank
                turned the 6ft 4in Klopp into a success at Mainz, where he played 325 games in a decade-long career. But
                it was the sudden decision to install him as manager that really brought out his strengths.. Jürgen
                Klopp has always described his playing ability as average with a good
                footballing brain as he says, "I had fourth-division feet and a first-division head." Jürgen retired at
                Mainz 05 as their record top goalscorer, registering a total of 56 goals in total. </p>

            <h3>Mainz 05</h3>
            <p>After Klopp retired as a player from Mainz in 2001 he went on to be appointed as their coach for the
                remainder of the 00/01 season. Klopp went on to win his first match in charge of Mainz and six out of
                his
                first seven games in charge for them helping them to avoid relagation. Klopp went on to guide Mainz to a
                4th
                place finish in the 2. Bundesliga two years in a row but was denied promotion following late drama on
                the
                final game of the season. The following season in 03/04 Klopp managed to one-up his previous seasons
                fourth-place finish and was able to lead Mainz to a third-place finish in the league and gain promotion
                to
                the top-flight of German football, securing Bundesliga football for the first time in the club's long
                history.</p>
            <p>Mainz enjoyed three years in the Bundesliga, even though they had the smallest stadium and budget in the
                league at the time, finishing in 11th place in their first two years in the top-flight whilst obtaining
                qualification to the UEFA CUP. However in their third season in the Bundesliga 06/07, Mainz and Klopp
                were
                relegated back to the second division, Klopp decided to stay with Mainz after the relegation to see if
                he
                could turn it around and take them back to the Bundesliga. In spite of that Klopp decided to resign at
                the
                end of the 07/08 season as he was unable to achieve promotion to the Bundesliga. He resigned with a
                record
                of 109 wins, 78 draw and 83 losses for Mainz.</p>

            <h3>Borussia Dortmund</h3>
            <p>In 2008 Klopp became the new manager of Borussia Dortmund who had suffered a dissapointing previous
                season
                finishing in 13th place. In Klopp's first season in charge with Dortmund he won the first trophy of his
                managerial career and his first for the club managing to defeat the champions of Germany Bayern Munich
                to
                the 2008 German Supercup. The following season in charge Jürgen Klopp managed to guide Dortmund to
                European
                football with a fith-place finish even though he posessed one of the youngest squads in the Bundesliga.
            </p>
            <p>In the 2010/11 Bundesliga season, Klopp's Borussia Dortmund went on a big win streak which helped them
                along
                their way to secure their seventh league title and Jürgen Klopp's first as a manager. Klopp's side wrote
                history that year as they were were the youngest ever side to win the Bundesliga. The following year in
                the
                2011/12 season Klopp's kids went on to further etch themselves in German history by successfully
                defending
                their league title amassing 81 points that season which set a record for the greatest points total in
                Bundesliga history Dortmund lost the 2011 DFL-Supercup against rivals Schalke 04 but in May 2012 Klopp
                sealed the clubs first ever domestic double defeating Bayern Munich to win the 2012 DFB-Pokal final.</p>
            <p>In the 2012/13 season Borussia Dortmund's league campaign began to deterioriate in comparison to previous
                seasons. Due to this Klopp decided to prioritise the UEFA Champions League to make up for their league
                form.
                Klopp's side went on a very impressive run defeating the toughest teams in the competition along the way
                to
                make it to the final. Narrowly losing the final to Bayern Munich was one disappointment in a load of
                losses
                for Borussia Dortmund as they lost the 2012 DFL-Supercup, were knocked out of the DFC-Pokal in one of
                the
                early rounds and finished in second-place in the Bundesliga to Bayern Munich finishing the season with
                zero
                trophies.</p>
            <p>Borussia Dortmund went onto win the DFL-Supercup for the next two consecutive seasons losing two players
                that
                was vital to their success to their rivals. Following the disappointing start to their 14/15 season
                Klopp
                announced that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season. Dortmund went on a better run of
                form
                after Klopp annonuced his intention to leave Dortmund but not enough to turn their form around. Dortmund
                finished in seventh place in the league and were knocked out of the rest of the competitions that they
                were
                involved in. Jürgen Klopp finished at Dortmund with a record of 180 wins, 69 draws and 70 losses.</p>

            <h3>Liverpool FC</h3>
            <p>In 2015 1. FSV Mainz 05 became the manager of Liverpool FC, Klopp came in with big statements of his
                intentions to deliver trophies to Liverpool within four years which the club had been lacking whilst
                going
                through a rough period for a number of years. In Jürgen Klopp's debut season as Liverpool manager he was
                able to guide the club to two cup finals guiding his Liverpool side to the League Cup final and their
                first
                European final since 2007, Liverpool went on to lose both the League Cup and the Europa League finals.
                Liverpool went on to finish in eigth place in the Premier League for the 15/16 season, however the mood
                around the town had changed with the positive thoughts of what could be possible with Jürgen Klopp at
                the
                helm. </p>
            <p>At the end of his debut season, Klopp was given a long-term contract extension of six years. The
                following
                season Liverpool achieved qualification for the Champions League for the first time since 2014/15.
                Jürgen
                Klopp managed to guide Liverpool to their first Champions League final since 2007 in the 2017/18 season.
                However Klopp's Liverpool side went on to lose 3-1 in the final to Real Madrid which made six defeats in
                seven major finals for Klopp.</p>
            <p>In the 2018/19 Liverpool were knocked out of all domestic trophies very early on in the season but went
                on a
                very impressive run in the league amassing 97 points, the third-highest points total in the English
                top-division and the most points gathered by a team without winning the league title. Although success
                eluded Liverpool in domestic competitions, Liverpool went on to enjoy a FA Champions League run that
                would
                go down in history winning the club's sixth European Cup. Jürgen Klopp went on to be voted The Best FIFA
                Men's Coach for 2019. </p>
            <p>The following year Liverpool went on to win the European Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup making this side
                the
                first English team to win the international treble of the Champions League, Super Cup and Club World
                Cup. In
                the months following the Club World Cup Liverpool went continued the form they had been building and
                pressed
                ahead amassing a club record 99 points, the second-highest points tally in top-flight history finishing
                18
                points clear of sceond place. Winning the nineteenth league title for the club, the first since 1989/90
                season and the first during the Premier League era. Jürgen Klopp was named the Best FIFA Men's Coach for
                the
                second year in a row</p>
            <p>The following year Liverpool went on to deliver a lackluster season in comparison to what was expected of
                them, finishing in third-place in the league. In the 2021/22 season Jürgen Klopp's Liverpool were back
                to
                their regular self reaching every final available to them. Liverpool went on to win the 2022 EFL Cup,
                the
                first time they had won the competition since 2012, the 2022 FA Cup final becoming their first FA cup
                win
                since 2006 making Jürgen Klopp the first German manager to win the troph. Unfortunately for Klopp
                Liverpool
                would finish second in the Premier League by one point and then go on to lose 1-0 to Real Madrid in the
                2022
                UEFA Champions League final.</p>
            <p>The following seasons began to show the decline of Klopp's Liverpool side as they failed to qualify for
                the
                Champions League and failed to compete in the cup competitions. In the 2023/24 season Klopp announced
                that
                he would be leaving his role as Liverpool manager at the end of the season as he is "running out of
                energy"
                and wishes to take a break from football management. Klopp went on to lead Liverpool to win the 2024 EFL
                Cup
                final defeating Chelsea in would be his last trophy for Liverpool. Jürgen Klopp finished at Liverpool a
