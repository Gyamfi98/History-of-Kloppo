        <h2>Childhood & Early Life</h2>
        <p>Jürgen Norbert Klopp was born on 16th June 1967 in Stuttgart to Elisabeth & Norbert Klopp, who also played
            football as a goalkeeper but was persuaded to focus on education by his father so rejected the opportunity
            to go professional. Instead he became a travelling salesman selling dowels and wall fixtures for a living.
            Since Norbert Klopp was an active sportsman in his youth he shared that part of his life with his son Jürgen
            putting him through rigorous physical training. Klopp went on to try many sports in his youth such as
            skiing, tennis, football and padel.</p>
        <p>Jürgen Klopp grew up with two elder sisters in the Black Forest which is a village of Glatten near
            Freudenstadt. Growing up Jürgen Klopp aspired to be a doctor but never believed he was smart enough to
            pursue a career in the field of medicine. In his youth Jürgen Klopp played for many teams including TuS
            Ergenzingen as a junior player, 1. FC Pforzheim and then at, Eintracht Frankfurt II, Viktoria Sindlingen and
            Rot-Weiss Frankfurt. In 1988 Jürgen Klopp attended the Goethe University to study sport science, in which he
            graduated in 1995</p>
            <p>Despite Klopp's subsequent success in lifting numerous trophies in his career, a poignant absence looms large in his achievements - his father Norbert. Tragically, Norbert passed away four months before Klopp secured his inaugural coaching role at Mainz in 2001. In interviews, Klopp, has openly shared the impact Norbert had on his life. He revealed that his father, who faced the disappointment of a prematurely ended football career, became a driving force, pushing him forward.

        <h2>Playing Career</h2>
        <p>Jürgen Klopp played a majority of his career as an amateur and in the lower leagues of German football.
            Whilst Jürgen was playing as an amateur, he worked a number of part time jobs such as a video rental store
            clerk and loading heavy goods onto lorries which his naturally bigger physique would have helped him in, as
            it was also a big part of his game in his playing career. In the summer of 1990 whilst Klopp was still
            attending Goethe University of Frankfurt he was signed by Mainz 05 for his first big professional football
            contract.</p>
        <p>Klopp played a majority of his professional career for Mainz 05 spanning 11 years and ending in 2001. Whilst
            Jürgen Klopp played for Mainz he immediately became a fan favorite due to his positive attitude and
            commitment to the club. Klopp began his Mainz career playing as a striker, however in the year that he
            obtained his diploma from the Goethe University of Frankfurt Jürgen Klopp suffered a change of position from
            striker to defender. Jürgen Klopp has always described his playing ability as average with a good
            footballing brain as he says, "I had fourth-division feet and a first-division head." Jürgen retired at
            Mainz 05 as their record top goalscorer, registering a total of 56 goals in total. </p>

        <h2>Managerial Career</h2>
        <h3>Mainz 05</h3>
        <p>After Klopp retired as a player from Mainz in 2001 he went on to be appointed as their coach for the
            remainder of the 00/01 season. Klopp went on to win his first match in charge of Mainz and six out of his
            first seven games in charge for them helping them to avoid relagation. Klopp went on to guide Mainz to a 4th
            place finish in the 2. Bundesliga two years in a row but was denied promotion following late drama on the
            final game of the season. The following season in 03/04 Klopp managed to one-up his previous seasons
            fourth-place finish and was able to lead Mainz to a third-place finish in the league and gain promotion to
            the top-flight of German football, securing Bundesliga football for the first time in the club's long
            history.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/mainz-klopp-manager.jpg" alt="Klopp as manager of Mainz"> <aside><h4 class="left">Jürgen Klopp as manager of 1. FSV Mainz 05</h4></aside>
        <p>Mainz enjoyed three years in the Bundesliga, even though they had the smallest stadium and budget in the
            league at the time, finishing in 11th place in their first two years in the top-flight whilst obtaining
            qualification to the UEFA CUP. However in their third season in the Bundesliga 06/07, Mainz and Klopp were
            relegated back to the second division, Klopp decided to stay with Mainz after the relegation to see if he
            could turn it around and take them back to the Bundesliga. In spite of that Klopp decided to resign at the
            end of the 07/08 season as he was unable to achieve promotion to the Bundesliga. He resigned with a record
            of 109 wins, 78 draw and 83 losses for Mainz.</p>

        <h3>Borussia Dortmund</h3>
        <img src="assets/img/klopp-german-cup.webp" alt="Jurgen Klopp holding the German Cup"> <aside><h4 class="left">Jürgen Klopp holding German Cup for Borussia Dortmund</h4></aside>
        <p>In 2008 Klopp became the new manager of Borussia Dortmund who had suffered a dissapointing previous season
            finishing in 13th place. In Klopp's first season in charge with Dortmund he won the first trophy of his
            managerial career and his first for the club managing to defeat the champions of Germany Bayern Munich to
            the 2008 German Supercup. The following season in charge Jürgen Klopp managed to guide Dortmund to European
            football with a fith-place finish even though he posessed one of the youngest squads in the Bundesliga. </p>
            <img src="assets/img/dortmund-klopp.jpg" alt="Klopp lifting Bündesliga"> <aside><h4 class="left">Jürgen Klopp lifting Bundesliga for Borussia Dortmund</h4></aside>
        <p>In the 2010/11 Bundesliga season, Klopp's Borussia Dortmund went on a big win streak which helped them along
            their way to secure their seventh league title and Jürgen Klopp's first as a manager. Klopp's side wrote
            history that year as they were were the youngest ever side to win the Bundesliga. The following year in the
            2011/12 season Klopp's kids went on to further etch themselves in German history by successfully defending
            their league title amassing 81 points that season which set a record for the greatest points total in
            Bundesliga history Dortmund lost the 2011 DFL-Supercup against rivals Schalke 04 but in May 2012 Klopp
            sealed the clubs first ever domestic double defeating Bayern Munich to win the 2012 DFB-Pokal final.</p>
        <p>In the 2012/13 season Borussia Dortmund's league campaign began to deterioriate in comparison to previous
            seasons. Due to this Klopp decided to prioritise the UEFA Champions League to make up for their league form.
            Klopp's side went on a very impressive run defeating the toughest teams in the competition along the way to
            make it to the final. Narrowly losing the final to Bayern Munich was one disappointment in a load of losses
            for Borussia Dortmund as they lost the 2012 DFL-Supercup, were knocked out of the DFC-Pokal in one of the
            early rounds and finished in second-place in the Bundesliga to Bayern Munich finishing the season with zero
            trophies.</p>
        <p>Borussia Dortmund went onto win the DFL-Supercup for the next two consecutive seasons losing two players that
            was vital to their success to their rivals. Following the disappointing start to their 14/15 season Klopp
            announced that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season. Dortmund went on a better run of form
            after Klopp annonuced his intention to leave Dortmund but not enough to turn their form around. Dortmund
            finished in seventh place in the league and were knocked out of the rest of the competitions that they were
            involved in. Jürgen Klopp finished at Dortmund with a record of 180 wins, 69 draws and 70 losses.</p>

        <h3>Liverpool FC</h3>
        <p>In 2015 1. FSV Mainz 05 became the manager of Liverpool FC, Klopp came in with big statements of his
            intentions to deliver trophies to Liverpool within four years which the club had been lacking whilst going
            through a rough period for a number of years. In Jürgen Klopp's debut season as Liverpool manager he was
            able to guide the club to two cup finals guiding his Liverpool side to the League Cup final and their first
            European final since 2007, Liverpool went on to lose both the League Cup and the Europa League finals.
            Liverpool went on to finish in eigth place in the Premier League for the 15/16 season, however the mood
            around the town had changed with the positive thoughts of what could be possible with Jürgen Klopp at the
            helm. </p>
        <p>At the end of his debut season, Klopp was given a long-term contract extension of six years. The following
            season Liverpool achieved qualification for the Champions League for the first time since 2014/15. Jürgen
            Klopp managed to guide Liverpool to their first Champions League final since 2007 in the 2017/18 season.
            However Klopp's Liverpool side went on to lose 3-1 in the final to Real Madrid which made six defeats in
            seven major finals for Klopp.</p>
        <p>In the 2018/19 Liverpool were knocked out of all domestic trophies very early on in the season but went on a
            very impressive run in the league amassing 97 points, the third-highest points total in the English
            top-division and the most points gathered by a team without winning the league title. Although success
            eluded Liverpool in domestic competitions, Liverpool went on to enjoy a FA Champions League run that would
            go down in history winning the club's sixth European Cup. Jürgen Klopp went on to be voted The Best FIFA
            Men's Coach for 2019. </p>
        <p>The following year Liverpool went on to win the European Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup making this side the
            first English team to win the international treble of the Champions League, Super Cup and Club World Cup. In
            the months following the Club World Cup Liverpool went continued the form they had been building and pressed
            ahead amassing a club record 99 points, the second-highest points tally in top-flight history finishing 18
            points clear of sceond place. Winning the nineteenth league title for the club, the first since 1989/90
            season and the first during the Premier League era. Jürgen Klopp was named the Best FIFA Men's Coach for the
            second year in a row</p>
        <p>The following year Liverpool went on to deliver a lackluster season in comparison to what was expected of
            them, finishing in third-place in the league. In the 2021/22 season Jürgen Klopp's Liverpool were back to
            their regular self reaching every final available to them. Liverpool went on to win the 2022 EFL Cup, the
            first time they had won the competition since 2012, the 2022 FA Cup final becoming their first FA cup win
            since 2006 making Jürgen Klopp the first German manager to win the troph. Unfortunately for Klopp Liverpool
            would finish second in the Premier League by one point and then go on to lose 1-0 to Real Madrid in the 2022
            UEFA Champions League final.</p>
        <p>The following seasons began to show the decline of Klopp's Liverpool side as they failed to qualify for the
            Champions League and failed to compete in the cup competitions. In the 2023/24 season Klopp announced that
            he would be leaving his role as Liverpool manager at the end of the season as he is "running out of energy"
            and wishes to take a break from football management. Klopp went on to lead Liverpool to win the 2024 EFL Cup
            final defeating Chelsea in would be his last trophy for Liverpool. Jürgen Klopp finished at Liverpool a
            record of 299 wins, 109 draws and 83 losses.</p>
